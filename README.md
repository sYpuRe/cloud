What is this repository for?
This is a php and mysql based cloud implementation with user login facilities.

How do I get set up?
to setup this project you need to put all the files in root folder(htdocs in case of xampp) and then you need to create a databse on mysql(phpmyadmin) named cloud. Once you have the database you need to create a table named login with six columns as follows: id(auto-increament) user(varchar) pass(varchar) email(varchar) phone(int) pic(varchar) once you are done with the table refresh the index.php page and you good to go. Have fun with learning projects!!!
